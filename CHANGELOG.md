# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Downloads arrive in `incomplete/` and move to `complete/<album> [<id>]` when finished, where they wait for import — or, when the tagger cannot place them, for a person. On the library's drive that makes an import a rename, and leaves anything unresolved somewhere browsable (`COMPLETE_DIR`).
- The chart mounts the library and the download directory as local PersistentVolumes pinned to the media node by hostname, rather than hostPath volumes selected by label. Each volume sits on the directory itself, not the drive's mountpoint, so an unmounted drive leaves the pod waiting instead of writing to the root disk. `library` and `downloads` are paths; `node` replaces `nodeLabel`.

## 0.1.0

- The protocol crate, the async engine, and the service around it: jobs that carry a folder from a peer into the library through sift, a GraphQL API, an MCP server with `slsk_schema` and `slsk` tools, and a Datastar web UI.
- A Pulumi component that deploys the service with its Postgres, a UPnP mapper for the peer port, and a NetworkPolicy confining it to the internet, the gateway and Traefik.
